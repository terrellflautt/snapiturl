snapiturl.com has major issues because it is supposed to be an SEO driven landing page for short urls not 

the feedback form that pops up is intrusive and the maybe later button doesnt even work, all feedback forms for snapitsaas@gmail.com /any snapitsoftware.com, snapitsaas.com product (snapitqr.com, snapiturl.com, snapitforms.com, snapitanalytics.com, pdf.snapitsoftware.com, urlstatuschecker.com, or etc, should use the access code for web3forms which is 941dde05-6699-4793-b170-fb81b1659e32
that way whenever user submit a contact form to us from any of our websites it will always go to snapitsaas@gmail.com
